# Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualizer

A 2D grid-based visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm using **SFML** in C++. This program allows you to interactively create walls, define start and end points, and see how Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**:
  - Left-click: Add walls to the grid.
  - Right-click: Remove walls from the grid.
  - Start point: Top-left corner (green).
  - End point: Bottom-right corner (red).
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization**:
  - Blue cells: Nodes visited by the algorithm.
  - Yellow cells: Final shortest path.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Visual feedback on algorithm progress.
  - Fully interactive before the algorithm runs.

## Prerequisites
1. **SFML Library**:
   - Download and install SFML from [sfml-dev.org](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
   - Ensure itâ€™s correctly linked to your C++ development environment.
2. **C++ Compiler**:
   - A modern C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
3. **Operating System**:
   - Windows, macOS, or Linux.
